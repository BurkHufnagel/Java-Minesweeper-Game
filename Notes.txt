Minesweeper Notes:

Objects of interest:
    Image[] img -- each image is one state for a cell:
        0 - empty open cell - means no neighbors have a mine
        1-8 - how many neighbors have a mine
        9 - cell containing a mine
        10 - Unopened cell - blank tile
        11 - Unopened cell flagged as having a mine
        12 - Incorrectly flagged cell -- only shown when the game is lost

    int field[] -- holds all the cell values for the board

    Class MinesAdapter handles mouse clicks

   Logic:
    Cell neighbors are the cells a Chess King could move to from that cell.
        Examples given the 3x4 board below:
          00 01 02 03   Cell 00 neighbors are 01, 04, and 05
          04 05 06 07   Cell 01 neighbors are 00, 02, 04, 05, and 06
          08 09 10 11   Cell 11 eighbors are  06, 07, and 10


    When the game is over, any click (right or left) will start a new game

    Right-clicking a covered cell toggles whether or not it is flagged.
        When flagged, MARK_FOR_CELL is added to the cell value.
        When the flag is removed, MARK_FOR_CELL is subtracted
        Either way, the status bar is set to the number of flags left, or 'No marks left' if there are none.
    Right-clicking a covered cell does nothing

    Left-clicking a flagged cell does nothing


    During paint() the game tracks the number of unflagged mine cells.
        If it's zero and the game is not over, the player wins.
    After paint() draws the board and checks for a win, if inGame is false the player loses.
